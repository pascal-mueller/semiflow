Torch based deep learning framework implementing semiring backpropagation

It uses PyTorch for elemental operations but implements its own computational
graph and backpropagation.

# Run
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `source .venv/bin/activate`


#Â Computational Graph
- How do I build the computational graph?

# Semiring-Backpropagation
- How do I write the semiring backpropagation?
